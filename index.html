				<h2>Expatriation</h2>
			<p>
				As I said, I lived in China for 4 years. My family and I were located about an hour and half to two hours away from Shanghai in a city called Suzhou. It is quite famous for its garden. This experience taught me so much and I got to discover new cultures because all my friends were from different countries and even from different continents. Sadly, I do not have the chance to see them very often but I get to discover new countries when I go visit them.

				<h2>Travelling</h2>
				<p>
					I had had the amazing opportunity to travel to many countries when I lived in China. It was truly amazing, I discovered lots of new cultures, very different from mine which I loved. We have been to many countries in Asia such as Thailand and Cambodia but also to Oceania when we visited Australia.

				<h2>Makeup</h2>
			<p>
				I love the makeup and beauty world, it is definetely a passion of mine. I could spend hours creating a look because I love playing with colours and the fact that you get to express yourself with makeup is so fun.
